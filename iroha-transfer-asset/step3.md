Now as we configured the library to use this particular key of Alice (which was pre-configured together with the account in the genesis block), she can send commands to the system.

This next snippet defines a list of commands that will be wrapped into a transaction and sent to Iroha.
With `AddAssetQuantity` command Alice will issue a certain amount of the asset `coin#test`.

You can wrap other commands into transactions - full list of commands and queries can be found in [Iroha docs](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.0/api/index.html).
There you can also find parameters that need to be transferred along with certain commands.

So, as Alice has all of the permissions, she also has a permission called `can_add_asset_qty` - it allows her to issue coins (basically, creating money out of thin air):
